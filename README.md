# Northwind Trading - Business Process Improvement - Microsoft-Visio-Modeling

## Project Overview

Northwind Trading, a successful eCommerce company, has experienced a **decline in sales** due to delays in order fulfillment. A business analysis revealed that **order processing and delivery times** were significantly longer than competitors, leading to **customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss**.

This project aims to **analyze, visualize, and optimize** the order fulfillment process using **Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN)**. The focus is on improving efficiency, reducing bottlenecks, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to **analyze the business activities, model the current process, and design an optimized solution**:

### Step 1: Business Activity Modeling  
- Identified **Northwind Trading’s key business activities**:  
  - **Planning activities** (strategy, demand forecasting)  
  - **Enabling activities** (supplier management, system support)  
  - **Doing activities** (order processing, fulfillment, shipping)  
  - **Monitoring activities** (order tracking, inventory control)  
  - **Control activities** (customer feedback, compliance)  
- Created a **Business Activity Model (BAM)** in **Microsoft Visio** to provide a high-level overview.

### Step 2: As-Is Process Modeling  
- Reviewed **Northwind Trading’s existing order fulfillment process**.  
- **Identified inefficiencies**:  
  - Manual approvals slowing down the process  
  - Redundant steps causing delays  
  - Lack of automation in key stages  
  - Inefficient communication between departments  
- Created a **BPMN 2.0 diagram** of the current process in **Microsoft Visio**.

### Step 3: To-Be Process Optimization  
- Analyzed possible improvements:  
  - **Automation** of repetitive manual tasks  
  - **Parallel processing** of order verification and shipping  
  - **Streamlined decision-making** with fewer approval bottlenecks  
  - **Improved coordination** between warehouse, logistics, and customer service  
- Designed the **To-Be BPMN 2.0 Model**, reflecting the optimized workflow.
